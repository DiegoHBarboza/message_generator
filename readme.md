### Topic Selected

*A reflection of the great book **The Science of Getting Rich** wrote by **Wallace D. Wattles**.* 

#### Book key quote:
*“There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe. A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought. A person can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.”*

Note: 
I misread the requirements and created a single source of data, which is the generation of a random number, and each number is linked to a message.
